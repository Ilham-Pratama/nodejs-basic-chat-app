## 💻 Get started locally in 5 minutes

- **Install the packages.**

  Make sure you have Docker up and running first before running the following command.

  Open a new terminal and start the server by running the following command.

  ```shell
  npm run dev:server
  ```

  Open another terminal and run the following command.

  ```shell
  npm run dev:bundler

  Don't forget to generate the styles as well 😉.
